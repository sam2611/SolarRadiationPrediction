<h2> Van Allen Belts</h2>
<p> The sun’s magnetic field are at the heart of the space weather phenomena such as space climate,
especially relevant over solar cycle or longer timescales is governed by 11 years’ sunspot cycle
which itself originates via magneto hydrodynamic(MHD) dynamo mechanism fed by plasma
flow in solar convection zone.
Solar eruptions such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originate in the magnetic flux
system associated with sunspots. </p>
<p> A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate
from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's
magnetosphere. Shaped in the form of two nested doughnuts, the inner belt starts from 600 -
1,600 km and extends till 9,600 - 13,000km and the outer belt starts from 13,500 - 19,000 km
and extends till 40,000 km. The gap between these two regions is known as the Slot Region. [1]
The Van Allen belts were first discovered in 1958 and for decades’ scientists thought there
were only two concentric belts. But days after the Van Allen Probes launched, scientists
discovered that during times of intense solar activity, a third belt can form.
This repositary consists of Python based Machine learning projects. Using the SolarRadiation data the Prediction model is trained and tested for predicting the Radiations in future so as to take prevention measure for the life on earth as well as the
damage to satellites.</p>
